At Cheesecake Labs, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Submitting an Issue/Pull Request

When creating a pull request, please check if there is already an existing issue related to your proposed changes, and create your branch based on the respective issue number: `1_media-queries`.

When you open your issue or pull request, please make sure to fill the issue or pull request templates in accordance to your proposed change.

It may be possible that it will take a few days to review your contribution. This is needed because we will discuss about your change internally to make sure it makes sense for everyone and for the project itself. Afterwards, we will reply by approving, asking changes or commenting on your proposed changes.
